# Flask_Challnege
DevOps/Data Engineer Challenge
Build a flask server with the following pages:

Index page
Uploader page where you can upload a file SMALLER THAN 1MB to an api
The API is hosted at https://patw1h5276.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/upload and accepts POST requests only at the specified URL.

The server must manage checking the file size and only send it if it's smaller than 1MB.
